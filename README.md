# Did I mention we have comfy chairs?

I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! You've swallowed a planet! I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself.

You know when grown-ups tell you 'everything's going to be fine' and you think they're probably lying to make you feel better? It's a fez. I wear a fez now. __Fezes are cool.__ *You've swallowed a planet!* You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas?

It's a fez. I wear a fez now. Fezes are cool. Saving the world with meals on wheels.

It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'! I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Stop talking, brain thinking. Hush.

You know how I sometimes have really brilliant ideas? You hit me with a cricket bat. I'm the Doctor, I'm worse than everyone's aunt. *catches himself* And that is not how I'm introducing myself. It's art! A statement on modern society, 'Oh Ain't Modern Society Awful?'!
